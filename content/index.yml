testimonials:
  - quote: "I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Kade over the past couple of years, and I continue to be impressed by his technical skills, ownership, and calm leadership under pressure. Most recently, he has led the development of a complex internal tool with minimal support—taking it from concept to production with clarity and care. As we near go-live, his thoughtful approach to incorporating feedback from beta users has made a measurable difference in the usability and impact of the product. He listens deeply, iterates quickly, and always balances technical decisions with user experience in mind."
